Code for: "Constructing Confidence Intervals for Average Treatment Effects from Multiple Datasets".

### Folder structure

Our python code are stored by different dataset in the folders, we take `rct_data` as an example:

1. `synthetic_data_generation`: script for generating datasets
2. `run_utils`: train models, create confidence intervals
3. `experiments_u/main`: run specific experiments and store results
4. `plot`: plot and summarize the results
